# CoffeeRateR
*This is a small webapp made with a MongoDB-Express-Node stack for learning purposes. This was made for the course VITMAV42 - Server-side JavaScript*

## Specification
We wish to create a system, where users can add coffees they have tasted and rate them, so that later they can look back and see which one is worth trying out again.
### Requirements
- The system must be able to handle, adding, deleting, and updating users and their profiles.
- Users should be able to edit their profile.
- Users profile information can contain username, country of origin, email, as well as their list of rated coffees.
- Coffee information can contains name, roast, the coffee roasting company's name, origin, description of the drink the user tried it with ( e.g. espresso,latte etc), user description of taste, and rating.
- Roast can be specified in a three tier system. (Ligth, Medium, Dark)
- The name of the coffe, and roasting company, as well as the description can be any text, obviously we'd like to keep them sensibly long.
- The rating of the coffees should be on a scale of 1 to 10.
